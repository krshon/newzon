            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>We believe in a transparent world where news is verified, trustworthy, and free of bias.</p>
            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, where information is consumed rapidly, distinguishing between truth and misinformation has never been more challenging. We saw a growing trend where people consumed news without knowing whether it was verified or even trustworthy. Our mission began with a simple yet powerful question: <strong>Why should people have to guess if the news they read is real?</strong></p>

            <h2>Why We Started</h2>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, news can be overwhelming. But it often lacks the transparency that we, as users, need. We realized that there was a huge gap in the market—news platforms that show not just the facts, but also their reliability and political bias. That's when NEWZON was born.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>NEWZON was founded with one goal in mind: to build a platform that provides verified news with complete transparency. We offer fact-checking tools, a bias indicator, and the ability to quickly gauge the reliability of news so that users can trust what they read.</p>

            <h2>How We Work: Truth Index & Political Bias Bar</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Truth Index</h3>
                <p>The **Truth Index** is a visual representation of how reliable and factual a piece of news is. We calculate this index based on verified sources, fact-checking databases, and algorithms that compare news stories to credible references. The higher the index, the more reliable the news.</p>
                <div class="truth-bar">
                    <div class="truth-bar-inner" style="width: 92%;" title="Truth Score: 92%"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Truth Score: 92%</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Political Bias</h3>
                <p>Our **Political Bias Bar** helps you understand the political leanings of the news. Whether it’s left-wing, right-wing, or neutral, we represent it through a simple color-coded bar to give you insights into the bias of the news source.</p>
                <div class="bias-bar" data-bias="right" title="Right Wing Bias">
                    <div class="bias-bar-inner" style="width: 70%;"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Bias: Right Wing</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Our Evolution</h2>
            <p>What started as an idea quickly grew into a platform driven by community feedback and constant improvement. We’ve come a long way, enhancing user experience, integrating innovative tools, and continuously pushing for more transparency in the digital age.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>Our vision is simple: To become the most trusted source of news where users feel confident in the information they consume. We aim to lead by example in the battle against misinformation and show people that transparency can go hand in hand with news consumption.</p>

            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>Behind NEWZON is a dedicated team of tech enthusiasts, data scientists, and journalists who believe in the power of truth. We’re constantly working to improve the platform and offer users the most reliable news available.</p>
