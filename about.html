            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>We believe in a transparent world where news is verified, trustworthy, and free of bias.</p>
            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, where information is consumed rapidly, distinguishing between truth and misinformation has never been more challenging. Our mission began with a simple yet powerful question: <strong>Why should people have to guess if the news they read is real?</strong></p>

            <h2>Why We Started</h2>
            <p>News can be overwhelming—but it often lacks transparency. We saw the gap: a platform that shows not just facts but also their reliability and political bias. That's when NEWZON was born.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to deliver verified news with complete transparency. With tools like fact-checking, a bias indicator, and a truth index, readers can trust what they consume.</p>

            <h2>How We Work: Truth Index & Political Bias Bar</h2>
            
            <!-- Truth Index -->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Truth Index</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Truth Index</strong> is our unique metric for assessing news reliability. It uses verified sources, fact-checking databases, and AI to detect manipulation. A score closer to 100% means the news is highly reliable.</p>
                <div class="truth-bar">
                    <div class="truth-bar-inner" style="width: 92%;" title="Truth Score: 92%"></div>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Truth Score:</strong> 92% — Verified by trusted sources and minimal opinionated content.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Political Bias -->
<!-- Political Bias -->
<div class="info-box">
    <h3>Political Bias</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Political Bias Bar</strong> helps visualize where a source stands politically.
        It analyzes tone, sources, references, and history. Categories include
        <span style="color: blue;">Left</span>,
        <span style="color: orange;">Right</span>, and
        <span style="color: grey;">Neutral</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="bias-bar" title="Bias Breakdown">
        <div class="bias-left" style="width: 30%;"></div>
        <div class="bias-neutral" style="width: 20%;"></div>
        <div class="bias-right" style="width: 50%;"></div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Bias:</strong> 30% Left, 20% Neutral, 50% Right</p>
</div>
